**Proposal: Agentic DevOps Assistant**

**1. Executive Summary**

This document details the proposal for the creation of an Agentic DevOps Assistant, an AI tool designed to automate and optimize repetitive and error-prone tasks associated with creating and managing AWS CDK products. The assistant will focus on improving DevOps team productivity, ensuring consistency in infrastructure configuration, and accelerating delivery cycles, aligning with DevOps best practices and emerging AI capabilities.

**2. Opportunity Identification (Based on Questionnaire)**

DevOps engineers spend considerable time on repetitive tasks such as generating and validating basic infrastructure stacks, manually configuring CI/CD pipelines, and reviewing/adjusting IAM security templates. Manually configuring a pipeline can take up to a month on projects with multiple environments. Common errors include incorrect IAM permissions, misconfigured environment variables, and inadequate deployment rules.

Automating these tasks would have a significant impact on productivity, resulting in greater consistency, fewer human errors, and accelerated deliveries. Although documentation exists in individual repositories and standard AWS/CDK conventions are followed, the lack of centralization and reliance on individual experience indicate an opportunity for standardization through an AI agent. Accessibility via AWS CLI and GitHub API facilitates integration. The team's readiness to adopt AI is currently low, but the existence of versioned CDK templates in GitHub provides a solid foundation for agent training.

**3. Agent Role and Capabilities**

The Agentic DevOps Assistant will operate as a hybrid agent, combining generation and validation capabilities. It must support variations in project structures and multi-language environments. Minor non-critical errors in test environments will be tolerated, with the need to detect and escalate IAM permission errors, stack dependencies, and critical deployments to humans.

The agent will integrate the following tools:

*   **AWS CDK CLI:** For generating and managing infrastructure stacks.
*   **GitHub API:** For repository management, including restricted access to private repositories with secure credentials.
*   **AWS CLI:** For deploying and validating Service Catalog products.
*   **Jira API:** For logging incidents and tasks.
*   **Microsoft Teams Webhooks:** For notifications and alerts.
*   **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild:** For integration with CI/CD workflows.

The ability to interpret and generate both YAML/JSON configurations and code will be required, and the agent must generate technical documentation in Markdown format. Operational limits will include not deleting existing resources and restricting operations to sandbox environments for testing.

**4. Agent Design**

*   **Ideal Workflow:** User Request → CDK Code Generation → Configuration and Security Validation → Deployment to Test/Staging Environments → Optional Human Review for Critical Approvals → Production Deployment.
*   **Inputs:** Product Name, Programming Language, Source Repository (URL and secure credentials), Deployment Environment.

    *   **Code and Security Validator Agent:** Reviews code quality, IAM security policies, and compliance with regulations.
    *   **Pipeline Orchestrator Agent:** Configures and manages CI/CD pipelines.
    *   **Documentation Agent:** Generates technical documentation.
*   **Human Review:** Critical points such as the validation of sensitive IAM roles and the approval of security configurations will require human intervention.
*   **Error Handling:** Automatic retries, rollback on critical failures, Microsoft Teams notifications, and detailed logs for diagnostics will be implemented.
*   **Selection Rules:** The agent will follow defined naming conventions and predefined security policies.
*   **Traceability:** Detailed logs will be maintained, configuration versioning will be used, and decisions will be stored in a database.
*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   Deployment time.
    *   Number of detected and corrected errors.
    *   Percentage of automation achieved.
    *   Man-hour savings.
    *   DevOps user satisfaction.
*   **Integration:** A custom CLI will be provided for agent invocation, allowing seamless integration with existing IDEs, terminals, and CI/CD workflows.

**5. Agent Implementation**

*   **Platform:** A Full-code solution will be chosen for maximum customization, utilizing Strands Agents and Amazon BedRock.
*   **AI Models:** Models such as Claude and Gemini will be evaluated for their ability to handle complex tasks and their flexibility.
*   **Generation Temperature:** A range of 0.3–0.4 will be used for an optimal balance between consistency and flexibility.
*   **APIs and Tools:** Integration with AWS CLI, AWS CDK CLI, GitHub API, MS Teams Webhook, Jira API.
*   **Validation:** Automated unit and integration tests, along with cross-validation against internal rules, will be implemented.
*   **Failure Recovery:** Mechanisms for automatic retries, rollback on critical failures, and alerts via MS Teams.
*   **Circuit Breakers:** Thresholds for consecutive failures and limits on external API consumption will be configured to prevent cascading errors.
*   **Scalability:** Will be designed with reusable templates, multi-tenant architecture, and parameterization to support multiple teams and projects.
*   **Progressive Trust:** A model of initial manual review, progressive QA validation, and increasing trust based on success metrics will be applied.
*   **Feedback:** Will be collected through user surveys, usage and error logs, and periodic review workshops.

**6. Final Evaluation and Added Value**

The proposed Agentic DevOps Assistant has a clear purpose, is aligned with the real needs of the DevOps team, and can be integrated with minimal friction into current workflows through a unified CLI. It possesses adequate security and control mechanisms, with a plan to demonstrate value within the first few weeks of use. It is designed for human-AI collaboration, not replacement. It includes a robust testing plan, mechanisms for handling exceptions and escalating decisions, and is prepared to grow with the organization.
